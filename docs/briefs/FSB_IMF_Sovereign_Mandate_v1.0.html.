## Opening Hook — Converting Unpriced Tail-Risk to Structural Certainty

Madam Chair, Governors: the global system sits atop an unprecedented concentration of **unpriced tail-risk**. Today’s AI-driven models (from trading to sovereign risk) rely on **probabilistic safety**: “probably safe” with a hidden failure term (ε). That term is, by design, **non-zero** and **unquantified** at the core of every system.

**TruthSeal™** converts that hidden risk into **Structural Certainty (Cₛ ≡ 1)**. We introduce the **Aim Coherence Score (ACS)**, a hardware-verified integrity metric emitted by the **TQC Coherence Core** (TQC = Traykov Law of Quantum Coherence). The Core **enforces the Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1)** in silicon through a **Coherence Sync Fabric (CSF)**, so incoherent execution paths are **physically blocked by design** rather than merely discouraged in software.

We request a **joint 120-day evaluation**: integrate the TQC Core in a reference flow and measure tail-risk reduction versus your existing probabilistic baselines. This is not a policy suggestion; it is a **digital physical law** required for stability in the next economic epoch.

## Mandate 1 — The Fiduciary ACS Standard

**Challenge.** Current fiduciary oversight cannot see coherence at the moment of action; it infers after the fact using probabilistic models.  
**Lawful fix.** The **ACS** is a real-time, hardware-signed proof of coherent operation.  
**Action.** Require all **Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs)** using advanced general intelligence (**AGI**) in high-impact workflows to **emit ACS telemetry to supervisors** and retain **signed receipts** per action (ACS value + time + monotonic counter + post-quantum signature).

---

## Mandate 2 — The Hardware Integrity Rule

**Challenge.** Integrity enforced in software remains probabilistic; supply chains are diverging into a low-cost, high-risk tier.  
**Lawful fix.** The **TQC Coherence Core** (with **LEI-Gate** and **CSF**) makes incoherent execution physically non-admissible.  
**Action.** For **critical national infrastructure** (sovereign cloud, payments/settlement, grids, defense): require **TQC-Certified Hardware** with **physical verification** of LEI-Gate and CSF, establishing a secure **Tier-1** integrity class.

---

## Mandate 3 — The Post-Quantum Resilience Act

**Challenge.** Quantum adversaries will break classical signatures; audit trails must remain valid across time.  
**Lawful fix.** The **TQC Receipt Standard** binds each action to **PQC** (post-quantum cryptography, e.g., NIST-selected lattice schemes) plus **public time anchoring**.  
**Action.** Adopt **ACS + PQC signature + public time anchor** (e.g., OpenTimestamps) as the **mandatory receipt format** for regulated AI systems.

## The Coherent Mandate — Installing Order

Across traditions there’s a name for the pattern that keeps reality stable—**ṛta**, fundamental order. Modern systems chase power and scale while leaving **integrity** to chance. The result is **probabilistic safety**: “probably safe” with a hidden failure term (ε) large enough to break markets and nations.

**TruthSeal™** doesn’t predict order; **we install it**. We make **coherence a law of operation**.

We enforce **LEI = 1 (Law of Ethical Irreversibility)**—implemented **in hardware** by the **TQC Coherence Core**. Inside the Core, the **LEI-Gate** conditions execution paths so that actions that violate LEI are **physically blocked by design**. Power without coherence cannot execute.

In that sense, **LEI = 1 is the dharma for machines**: once alignment is confirmed, deviation is prevented by **circuit**, not policy. We bind action to coherence so the power of **AGI** and **quantum computation** serves life, not chance.

We do not ask for trust—we **issue receipts**. Each action produces a **hardware-signed receipt** carrying the **ACS**, **anchored to public time** and secured with **PQC**. Anyone can audit them. That’s a promise we can stand behind—publicly, cryptographically, permanently.

## Conclusion — The TQC Migration Clock

The world must move from unpriced tail-risk to **Structural Certainty (Cₛ ≡ 1)**. The path is the **TQC Law**:

1) **Recognize two tiers.** **Tier-1 = TQC-Certified Hardware** (LEI-enforced, emits ACS receipts) for finance, energy, defense. **Tier-2 = probabilistic** systems declared high-risk.  
2) **Start the clock.** Require all **SIFIs** to **integrate ACS telemetry within 12 months**, shifting burden of proof from inspection to **hardware-verified integrity**.  
3) **Secure history.** Adopt the **TQC Receipt Standard** (ACS + PQC signature + public time anchor) so integrity survives the quantum era.

We’re not selling compliance; **we’re laying the rail the future must run on.**
